"""Deterministic scoring/diversity for the personalized "For You" feed.

Pure functions only (no DB access) so the ranking behavior can be unit
tested and tuned independently of the ``_for_you_feed`` resolver. Inputs are
values already available from existing denormalized post counters, the
follow graph, and ``AnalyticsRepository.creator_affinity`` (which itself
aggregates likes/saves/shares/watch-time/completion/rewatch/follow signals
from the unified ``InteractionSignal`` log) — no new signal sources.
